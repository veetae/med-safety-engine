# DISCLAIMER

## Important Clinical Use Limitations

**This software is provided for informational and educational purposes only.**

### Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment

The Med Safety Engine is a decision support tool designed to assist healthcare providers. It is NOT intended to replace professional medical judgment, clinical expertise, or the physician-patient relationship.

### Limitations

1. **Drug Database Coverage**: The current drug database covers approximately 100-150 commonly prescribed medications. Drugs not in the database will not trigger alerts even if clinically significant interactions exist.

2. **Not Comprehensive**: This engine does not detect all possible drug interactions, contraindications, or safety concerns. Absence of an alert does not guarantee medication safety.

3. **Clinical Context**: The engine cannot account for all clinical nuances, patient preferences, risk tolerance, or circumstances that a treating physician would consider.

4. **Guideline Currency**: Clinical guidelines change over time. While based on current standards (AGS Beers 2023, CDC Opioid Guidelines 2022), recommendations may become outdated.

5. **No Dose Calculations**: The engine flags categories of concern but does not calculate specific dose adjustments. Consult pharmacy resources for precise dosing.

### Intended Users

This tool is intended for use by:
- Licensed physicians
- Clinical pharmacists
- Healthcare organizations with appropriate clinical oversight

It is NOT intended for direct patient use or for making treatment decisions without physician review.

### No Warranty

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

### Clinical Responsibility

The prescribing physician retains full responsibility for all clinical decisions. Always:
- Verify alerts against authoritative drug references
- Consider the complete clinical picture
- Use professional judgment
- Document clinical rationale when overriding alerts

### Reporting Issues

If you identify a missed alert, false positive, or other clinical concern, please report it to improve the system.
